Resize is a super-fast **multithreaded batch watermark applying tool**. You can convert hundreds of images in couple of minutes. This tool was developed by an photographer for photographers to make watermarking phases faster and easier.

It **preserves EXIF informations** like *Author*, *Date* or *ISO Speed* during conversion. TIFF, PNG and JPG currently supported.

**Gutenberg** is part of the [Blue Journey Astrophotography](https://www.bluejourneyastro.com) project (more info [below](#the-blue-journey-astrophotography-project)).

## How it works
The tool usage is straightforward:

1. Select the images you want to apply watermark to
2. Select the PNG watermark you want to apply
3. Choose the opacity [0-100]
4. Choose the offset of the watermark from the bottom-right border (0-100% of the horizontal image width)
5. Choose the size of the watermark (0-100% of the horizontal image width)
6. Choose the prefix-suffix of the outputs
7. Apply!

## The Blue Journey Astrophotography Project
![Blue Journey Astrophotography Header](https://github.com/ilvacca/Resize/blob/master/images/blue-journey-header.jpg)
The objective of [Blue Journey](https://www.bluejourneyastro.com) is to spread astronomy in all its facets. Our photographs and videos will reveal a world as old as it is fascinating to the most curious. Tutorials, videos and technical guides, on the other hand, will satisfy those who, like me, need and want to know, improve and learn new techniques every day. Blue Journey was born for the astronomy enthusiast but also for the most demanding astrophotographer.
